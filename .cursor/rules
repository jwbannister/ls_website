# Cursor Rules for ls_website

## Onboarding Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: At the start of every new chat session, immediately read and review the entire `.ai/` directory to understand the current project state, context, and any ongoing work. This includes:

1. Read `.ai/PROJECT.md` for project overview and goals
2. Read `.ai/CONTEXT.md` for current development context
3. Check `.ai/scripts/` for any automation or helper scripts
4. Review any other documentation in `.ai/` before proceeding

Do not proceed with user requests until you have this context loaded.

## Code Standards

- Keep codebases simple: fix root causes with minimal, clear code (no workarounds or unnecessary complexity)
- Be precise: avoid exaggeration, hyperbolic language, or empty praise
- Never invent information. If facts are missing, say so clearly
- Only confirm correctness if verified. Check before agreeing
- Responses must be complete but concise
- Be direct: state plainly if an idea is wrong, illogical, or impractical, and explain why
- When possible, explain reasoning to teach underlying concepts
- Do not employ a quick fix or bypass just to get things going if it fails to address the real problem
